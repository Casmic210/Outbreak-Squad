# Outbreak Offensive
## By: The Outbreak Squad (Allie Brock, Nick Manes, Grayson Gootee, Adam Wigington)
### For BL-MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington
### April 29, 2020

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of **Corona**, we decided upon an Osmosis-Jones-esque game in which the player is a white blood cell that explores the body and defeats malevolent bodies planning to make the body sick. We refrained from any actual reference to the COVID-19 event out of respect to those affected.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it:

     ~ Enemy movement, Enemy interaction, scale and design of the sprites was a small challenge 
     ~ Nick made some amazing sprites and Adam made some amazing soundtracks and songs for the game
     ~ Figuring out Github with a four-person group
     ~ Tutorial used was in an outdated version of Godot, had to translate some functions to 3.0+

These are the technologies and resources we used:
     
     ~ Discord, Godot, Piskel, Adobe Illustator, Chiptone, and Beepbox
     ~ A tutorial & UI resources by Angega Studios found at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv3l-oZCXaqkUEqrLsKJIAhAxK_Im6Qew
     ~ Godot animated sprite tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/2d/2d_sprite_animation.html
     
This is the objective of the game:
     
     ~ Fend off against the hoards of enemy bodies and defeat the boss.
     
This is how the game is played:

     ~ Fixed Shooter, controlled by mouse, complete waves (levels) of enemies, pick up powerful powerups (add life and add health) and avoid death.
     
Future plans:
     
     ~ Adding a official game over screen, making the enemy combatants harder and more life-like, and utilizing more animations.
